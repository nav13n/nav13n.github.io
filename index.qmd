# Hey, I am Naveen!
<!-- ##### ML Engineer and Engineering Leader -->

I'm an ML engineer and engineering leader passionate about AI, machine learning, and scalable systems. At Jio Platforms, I lead teams developing AI-powered products across various verticals.

I've spent over 13 years leading products and teams from 0-1 and beyond, scaling AI systems and backend services, and architecting cloud-native platforms powering critical business operations. My expertise spans GenAI, Computer Vision, and MLOps, focusing on optimizing ML pipelines and scaling ML products for real-world applications.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, mentoring aspiring engineers, and experimenting with cooking.
