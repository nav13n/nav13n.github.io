# Hey! I'm Naveen

I'm an ML engineer and engineering leader passionate about AI, machine learning, and scalable systems. 
At Jio Platforms, I lead teams developing AI-powered products across various verticals.
</br> 
</br> Over the past 13 years, I've led products and teams from 0-1 and beyond, scaled AI systems and backend services, and architected cloud-native platforms powering critical business operations. My expertise spans GenAI, Computer Vision, and MLOps, focusing on optimizing ML pipelines for real-world applications. 
</br> 
</br> Before Jio, I contributed to autonomous vehicle map technology at Civil Maps, built high-performance backend infrastructure for social apps at Science Inc, developed financial services at GE, and led Mobile Banking Framework Development at Oracle. 
</br> 
</br> In my free time, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, mentoring aspiring engineers, and experimenting with cooking.
